#
# This script was designed to be used when migration Jamf Pro instances where an MDM profile
# is installed on the systems and needs to be removed prior to the migration.
#
# In addition, this script will also remove the MDM profile installed on a managed Mac, 
# enroll to a new Jamf Pro, and re-establish DEP. 
# This locks User-Approved MDM in place, with minimal user interaction.
#
# To accomplish this the following will be performed:
#           - Record pre-migration state data at /Library/$myOrg/Data/com.$myOrg.jamfLocalExtensionAttributes.plist
#				- Exit with error if FileVault operations are in progress or FileVault state cannot be determined
#			- Attempt MDM profile removal via Jamf binary
#           - Attempt MDM profile removal via Jamf API sending an MDM UnmanageDevice command
#           - Lastly, if failed to remove MDM Profile the /var/db/ConfigurationProfiles
#             folder will be renamed.
#           - Compensate for Jamf PI-005441
#				- Pause to allow user to accept DEP enrollment
#				- Set correct values for remote_management fields via Jamf API
#				- Reassert management framework and continue enrollment policies
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#       - One Jamf Pro URL to read original data from:
#           - Jamf Pro API User with permission to read computer objects
#           - Jamf Pro API User with permission to send management commands
#       - Another Jamf Pro URL to enroll to
#           -  A reusable enrollment invitation code (from Recon.app or SMTP invitation)
#       - Script must be executed as root (due to profiles command)
#
# EXIT CODES:
#           0 - Everything is Successful
#           1 - Unable to remove MDM Profile
